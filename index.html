    <h1>Start your own food blog </h1>
    <p>Here are the basic steps to set up a self-hosted WordPress food blog that is both beautiful and functional. Your
        blog will have your own domain name and your own distinct look, and it will be able to scale with you as your
        blog grows. When youâ€™re starting a food blog, I recommend following these steps for a greater shot at success
    </p>
    <h1>Name your blog and buy a matching domain name</h1>
    <p>Domain names are short, memorable and typically end in .com (yourblogname.com).
        Cost: free with Bluehost or around $15 per year elsewhere</p>
